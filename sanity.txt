ViewModel -> Manages all of teh data for the UI. Each fragment has their own viewmodel. 
DataBinding -> Links the UI to the data sources directly so there is no need for a refresh

changing the value using viewmodel wil update it in the rest
ProfileFragment.java and ProfileViewModel.java have all the comments
